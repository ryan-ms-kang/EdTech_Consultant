# Freelance EdTech Data Engineering & Analytics Work

## Overview

An EdTech platform (name hidden for privacy concerns), wanted to increase the percentage of students who finish their bootcamps through the online platform they launched last year. Completion rates had dropped over the past year, with many students becoming inactive halfway through. The academy lacked in-house analytics resources — they had event logs but no structured analysis or insight into why students disengage.

My objective was to mine their raw user event data (video watches, quiz attempts, course completions, forum posts) and uncover specific early warning signals of disengagement that could guide targeted interventions.

DISCLAIMER: a fake dataset was generated for anonymity and privacy concerns.

### Key Features
- **Data Pipelines:** Automated workflows for ingesting and cleaning raw data.
- **BigQuery Integration:** SQL-based transformations and analytics on educational datasets.
- **Python Scripts:** Custom logic for data preprocessing and validation.
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Example DAGs to demonstrate scheduling and dependency management.
- **Scalable Design:** A modular setup to extend for larger datasets or advanced analytics.

## Contents
- **scripts/** – Python scripts for data transformations, loading, and testing.
- **bigquery/** – SQL queries and schema definitions used for analysis.
- **dags/** – Example DAGs for orchestrating ETL pipelines.
- **docs/** – Documentation outlining the pipeline and data flow.
- **data/** – Sample datasets for testing.

## Goal
The goal is to showcase an end-to-end data pipeline that combines **data engineering best practices** with **analytics-ready outputs**, focusing on **realistic education platform use cases** (e.g., user engagement, course completion, and content performance).
