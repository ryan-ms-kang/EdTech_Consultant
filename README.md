# EdTech Data Engineering & Analytics Project

## Overview

This project simulates a complete data engineering and analytics workflow for an EdTech platform. It integrates data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analysis using modern data tools.

### Key Features
- **Data Pipelines:** Automated workflows for ingesting and cleaning raw data.
- **BigQuery Integration:** SQL-based transformations and analytics on educational datasets.
- **Python Scripts:** Custom logic for data preprocessing and validation.
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Example DAGs to demonstrate scheduling and dependency management.
- **Scalable Design:** A modular setup to extend for larger datasets or advanced analytics.

## Contents
- **scripts/** – Python scripts for data transformations, loading, and testing.
- **bigquery/** – SQL queries and schema definitions used for analysis.
- **dags/** – Example DAGs for orchestrating ETL pipelines.
- **docs/** – Documentation outlining the pipeline and data flow.
- **data/** – Sample datasets for testing.

## Goal
The goal is to showcase an end-to-end data pipeline that combines **data engineering best practices** with **analytics-ready outputs**, focusing on **realistic education platform use cases** (e.g., user engagement, course completion, and content performance).
